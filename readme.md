Install Directions:

Directions:

To install these just go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Zune\Applications` and paste the files there. If that folder doesn't exist create it.

Also you'll need to apply the registry tweak as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/15i55n/miss_your_zune_hd_apps/

Also ColorSpill works ONLY if you don't install Reversi. If you install Reversi ColorSpill will start Reversi instead of it's own app. It's a glitch that was never fixed by Microsoft before they took the Marketplace down.
